A contact manager is a software application that is used to store and manage a list of contacts. This can include personal and professional contacts, as well as contact information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses. 

A Node.js REST API is an API that uses the Node.js runtime  to build and expose a set of endpoints that can be used to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a contact manager's database.

This readme file provides a short introduction to the Node.js REST API for a contact manager app.
